Newton's laws of motion: The first law states that an object at rest tends to stay at rest, and an object in motion tends to stay in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an external force. The second law relates the force applied to an object, its mass, and its acceleration. The third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. These laws govern the overall motion and forces acting on Mike and his snowboard.\n"]}],"source":["# ?\n","\"\"\"\n","import requests\n","import json\n","\n","url = \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/chat\"\n","headers = {\n","    \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n","    \"Authorization\": \"Bearer \" + os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"]\n","}\n","data = {\n","    \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n","    \"messages\": [\n","        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"hello!\"}\n","    ],\n","    \"temperature\": 0,\n","}\n","\n","response = requests.post(url=url, headers=headers, json=data)\n","print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","# load model\n","from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\n","\n","chat = ChatOpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", temperature=0)\n","\n","\"\"\"\n","result = chat.predict(\"自己紹介してください。\")\n","print(result)\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","# prompt\n","from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\n","\n","template = \"\"\"\n","Question: {question}\n","Answer:Please identify the objects related to the movement.
